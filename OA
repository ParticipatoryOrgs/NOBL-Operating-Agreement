The Members agree that such valuation is a good-faith attempt at fixing the value of the interest, after taking into account that the interest does not include all of the rights of a Member or Manager, and after deducting damages that are due to the material breach of this Agreement.

**ARTICLE VI.        ALLOCATIONS**

**Section 6.01 Allocation of Net Income and Net Loss.**

For each Fiscal Year (or portion thereof), except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Net Income and Net Loss (and, to the extent necessary, individual items of income, gain, loss or deduction) of the Company shall be allocated among the Members in a manner such that, after giving effect to the special allocations set forth in **Section 6.02** , the Capital Account balance of each Member, immediately after making such allocations, is, as nearly as possible, equal to (i) the Distributions that would be made to such Member pursuant to **Section 13.03(c)** if the Company were dissolved, its affairs wound up and its assets sold for cash equal to their Book Value, all Company liabilities were satisfied (limited with respect to each Nonrecourse Liability to the Book Value of the assets securing such liability), and the net assets of the Company were Distributed, in accordance with **Section 13.03(c)**, to the Members immediately after making such allocations, minus (ii) such Member&#39;s share of Company Minimum Gain and Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain, computed immediately prior to the hypothetical sale of assets.

**Section 6.02 Regulatory and Special Allocations.**

Notwithstanding the provisions of **Section 6.01** :

**(a)** If there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain (determined according to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(d)(1)) during any Fiscal Year, each Member shall be specially allocated Net Income for such Fiscal Year (and, if necessary, subsequent Fiscal Years) in an amount equal to such Member&#39;s share of the net decrease in Company Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g). The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(f)(6) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This **Section 6.02(a)** is intended to comply with the &quot;minimum gain chargeback&quot; requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

**(b)** Member Nonrecourse Deductions shall be allocated in the manner required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i). Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net decrease in Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year, each Member that has a share of such Member Minimum Gain shall be specially allocated Net Income for such Fiscal Year (and, if necessary, subsequent Fiscal Years) in an amount equal to that Member&#39;s share of the net decrease in Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. Items to be allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This **Section 6.02(b)** is intended to comply with the &quot;minimum gain chargeback&quot; requirements in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

**(c)** In the event any Member unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or Distributions described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6), Net Income shall be specially allocated to such Member in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit created by such adjustments, allocations or Distributions as quickly as possible. This **Section 6.02(c)** is intended to comply with the qualified income offset requirement in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

**(d)** The allocations set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above (the &quot; **Regulatory Allocations**&quot;) are intended to comply with certain requirements of the Treasury Regulations under Code Section 704. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this **Article VI** (other than the Regulatory Allocations), the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in allocating Net Income and Net Losses among Members so that, to the extent possible, the net amount of such allocations of Net Income and Net Losses and other items and the Regulatory Allocations to each Member shall be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated to such Member if the Regulatory Allocations had not occurred.

**(e)** The Company and the Members acknowledge that allocations like those described in Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(xii)(c) (&quot; **Forfeiture Allocations**&quot;) result from the allocations of Net Income and Net Loss provided for in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company is entitled to make Forfeiture Allocations and, once required by applicable final or temporary guidance, allocations of Net Income and Net Loss will be made in accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(xii)(c) or any successor provision or guidance.

**Section 6.03 Tax Allocations.**

**(a)** Subject to **Section 6.03(b)** through **Section 6.03(e)**, all income, gains, losses and deductions of the Company shall be allocated, for federal, state and local income tax purposes, among the Members in accordance with the allocation of such income, gains, losses and deductions among the Members for computing their Capital Accounts, except that if any such allocation for tax purposes is not permitted by the Code or other Applicable Law, the Company&#39;s subsequent income, gains, losses and deductions shall be allocated among the Members for tax purposes, to the extent permitted by the Code and other Applicable Law, so as to reflect as nearly as possible the allocation set forth herein in computing their Capital Accounts.

**(b)** Items of Company taxable income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the Company shall be allocated among the Members in accordance with Code Section 704(c) and the traditional method of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b), so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the Company for federal income tax purposes and its Book Value.

**(c)** If the Book Value of any Company asset is adjusted pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) as provided in clause (c) of the definition of Book Value, subsequent allocations of items of taxable income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to such asset shall take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such asset for federal income tax purposes and its Book Value in the same manner as under Code Section 704(c).

**(d)** Allocations of tax credit, tax credit recapture and any items related thereto shall be allocated to the Members according to their interests in such items as determined by the Board taking into account the principles of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii).

**(e)** The Company shall make allocations pursuant to this **Section 6.03** in accordance with the traditional method in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(d).

**(f)** Allocations pursuant to this **Section 6.03** are solely for purposes of federal, state and local taxes and shall not affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any Member&#39;s Capital Account or share of Net Income, Net Losses, Distributions or other items pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement.

**Section 6.04 Allocations in Respect of Transferred Units.**

In the event of a Transfer of Units during any Fiscal Year made in compliance with the provisions of **Article X** , Net Income, Net Losses and other items of income, gain, loss and deduction of the Company attributable to such Units for such Fiscal Year shall be determined using the interim closing of the books method.

**Section 6.05 Curative Allocations.**

In the event that the Tax Matters Member determines, after consultation with counsel experienced in income tax matters, that the allocation of any item of Company income, gain, loss or deduction is not specified in this **Article VI** (an &quot; **Unallocated Item**&quot;), or that the allocation of any item of Company income, gain, loss or deduction hereunder is clearly inconsistent with the Members&#39; economic interests in the Company (determined by reference to the general principles of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b) and the factors set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(3)(ii)) (a &quot; **Misallocated Item**&quot;), then the Board may allocate such Unallocated Items, or reallocate such Misallocated Items, to reflect such economic interests; provided, that no such allocation will be made without the prior consent of each Member that would be adversely and disproportionately affected thereby; and _provided_, _further_, that no such allocation shall have any material effect on the amounts distributable to any Member, including the amounts to be distributed upon the complete liquidation of the Company.

**ARTICLE VII.        DISTRIBUTIONS**

**Section 7.01 General.**

**(a)** Subject to **Section 7.01(b)**, **Section 7.02** and **Section 7.04** , the Board shall have sole discretion regarding the amounts and timing of Distributions to Members, including to decide to forego payment of Distributions in order to provide for the retention and establishment of reserves of, or payment to third parties of, such funds as it deems necessary with respect to the reasonable business needs of the Company (which needs may include the payment or the making of provision for the payment when due of the Company&#39;s obligations, including, but not limited to, present and anticipated debts and obligations, capital needs and expenses, the payment of any management or administrative fees and expenses, and reasonable reserves for contingencies).

**(b)** Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not make any Distribution to Members if such Distribution would violate the California Act or other Applicable Law.

**Section 7.02 Priority of Distributions.**

In the event of the Sale of the Company, Padstone Unitholders shall receive 70% of the total proceeds. Each individual Padstone Unitholder will participate in the distribution of that 70% of proceeds on a pro rata basis.

In the event of the Sale of the Company, Stake Unitholders shall receive 30% of the total proceeds. Each individual Stake Unitholder will participate in the distribution of that 30% of proceeds on a pro rata basis.

All other Distributions shall be made by the Board at their own discretion.

(B)  the proposed date, time and location of the closing of the Transfer, which shall not be less than 60 (sixty) days from the date of the Offering Member Notice;

(C)  the purchase price per Offered Unit (which shall be payable solely in cash) and the other material terms and conditions of the Transfer; and

(D)  the name of the Person who has offered to purchase such Offered Units.

**(ii)** The Offering Member Notice shall constitute the Offering Member&#39;s offer to Transfer the Offered Units to the Company and the ROFR Rightholders, which offer shall be irrevocable until the end of the ROFR Rightholder Option Period described in **Section 10.03(d)(iii)**.

**(iii)** By delivering the Offering Member Notice, the Offering Member represents and warrants to the Company and each ROFR Rightholder that:

(A)  the Offering Member has full right, title and interest in and to the Offered Units;

(B)  the Offering Member has all the necessary power and authority and has taken all necessary action to Transfer such Offered Units as contemplated by this Section 10.03; and

(C)  the Offered Units are free and clear of any and all liens other than those arising as a result of or under the terms of this Agreement.

**(d) Exercise of Right of First Refusal.**

**(i)** Upon receipt of the Offering Member Notice, the Company and each ROFR Rightholder shall have the right to purchase the Offered Units in the following order of priority: first, the Company shall have the right to purchase all or any portion of the Offered Units in accordance with the procedures set forth in **Section 10.03(d)(ii)**, and _thereafter_, the ROFR Rightholders shall have the right to purchase the Offered Units, in accordance with the procedures set forth in **Section 10.03(d)(iii)**, to the extent the Company does not exercise its right in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the ROFR Rightholders may only exercise their right to purchase the Offered Units if, after giving effect to all elections made under this **Section 10.03(d)**, no less than all of the Offered Units will be purchased by the Company and/or the ROFR Rightholders.

**(ii)** The initial right of the Company to purchase any Offered Units shall be exercisable with the delivery of a written notice (the &quot; **Company ROFR Exercise Notice**&quot;) by the Company to the Offering Member and the ROFR Rightholders within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the Offering Member Notice (the &quot; **Company Option Period**&quot;), stating the number (including where such number is zero) and type of Offered Units the Company elects irrevocably to purchase on the terms and respective purchase prices set forth in the Offering Member Notice. The Company ROFR Exercise Notice shall be binding upon delivery and irrevocable by the Company.

**(iii)** If the Company shall have indicated an intent to purchase any less than all of the Offered Units, the ROFR Rightholders shall have the right to purchase the remaining Offered Units not selected by the Company. For a period of fifteen (15) Business Days following the receipt of a Company ROFR Exercise Notice in which the Company has elected to purchase less than all the Offered Units (such period, the &quot; **ROFR Rightholder Option Period**&quot;), each ROFR Rightholder shall have the right to elect irrevocably to purchase all or none of its Pro Rata Portion of the remaining Offered Units by delivering a written notice to the Company and the Offering Member (a &quot; **Member ROFR Exercise Notice**&quot;) specifying its desire to purchase its Pro Rata Portion of the remaining Offered Units, on the terms and respective purchase prices set forth in the Offering Member Notice. In addition, each ROFR Rightholder shall include in its Member ROFR Exercise Notice the number of remaining Offered Units that it wishes to purchase if any other ROFR Rightholders do not exercise their rights to purchase their entire Pro Rata Portions of the remaining Offered Units.

**(iv)** The failure of the Company or any ROFR Rightholder to deliver a Company ROFR Exercise Notice or Member ROFR Exercise Notice, respectively, by the end of the Company Option Period or ROFR Rightholder Option Period, respectively, shall constitute a waiver of their respective rights of first refusal under this **Section 10.03** with respect to the Transfer of Offered Units, but shall not affect their respective rights with respect to any future Transfers.

**(e) Allocation of Offered Units.**  Upon the expiration of the ROFR Rightholder Option Period, the Offered Units not selected for purchase by the Company pursuant to **Section 10.03(d)(ii)** shall be allocated for purchase among the ROFR Rightholders as follows:

**(i)** First, to each ROFR Rightholder having elected to purchase its entire Pro Rata Portion of such Units, such ROFR Rightholder&#39;s Pro Rata Portion of such Units; and

**(ii)** Second, the balance, if any, not allocated under clause (i) above (and not purchased by the Company pursuant to **Section 10.03(d)(ii))**, shall be allocated to those ROFR Rightholders who set forth in their Member ROFR Exercise Notices a number of Offered Units that exceeded their respective Pro Rata Portions (the &quot; **Purchasing Rightholders**&quot;), in an amount, with respect to each such Purchasing Rightholder, that is equal to the lesser of:

(A)  the number of Offered Units that such Purchasing Rightholder elected to purchase in excess of its Pro Rata Portion; or

(B)  the product of (x) the number of Offered Units not allocated under clause (i) (and not purchased by the Company pursuant to **Section 10.03(d)(ii))**, multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Offered Units that such Purchasing Rightholder was permitted to purchase pursuant to clause (i), and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Offered Units that all Purchasing Rightholders were permitted to purchase pursuant to clause (i).

The process described in clause (ii) shall be repeated until no Offered Units remain or until such time as all Purchasing Rightholders have been permitted to purchase all Offered Units that they desire to purchase.

**(f) Consummation of Sale.**  In the event that the Company and/or the ROFR Rightholders shall have, in the aggregate, exercised their respective rights to purchase all and not less than all of the Offered Units, then the Offering Member shall sell such Offered Units to the Company and/or the ROFR Rightholders, and the Company and/or the ROFR Rightholders, as the case may be, shall purchase such Offered Units, within sixty (60) days following the expiration of the ROFR Rightholder Option Period (which period may be extended for a reasonable time not to exceed ninety (90) days to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain required approvals or consents from any Governmental Authority). Each Member shall take all actions as may be reasonably necessary to consummate the sale contemplated by this **Section 10.03(f)**, including, without limitation, entering into agreements and delivering certificates and instruments and consents as may be deemed necessary or appropriate. At the closing of any sale and purchase pursuant to this **Section 10.03(f)**, the Offering Member shall deliver to the Company and/or the participating ROFR Rightholders certificates (if any) representing the Offered Units to be sold, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances (other than those contained in this Agreement), accompanied by evidence of transfer and all necessary transfer taxes paid and stamps affixed, if necessary, against receipt of the purchase price therefor from the Company and/or such ROFR Rightholders by certified or official bank check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

**(g) Sale to Proposed Purchaser.** In the event that the Company and/or the ROFR Rightholders shall not have collectively elected to purchase all of the Offered Units, then, provided the Offering Member has also complied with the provisions of **Section 10.05** , to the extent applicable, the Offering Member may Transfer all of such Offered Units, at a price per Offered Unit not less than specified in the Offering Member Notice and on other terms and conditions which are not materially more favorable in the aggregate to the proposed purchaser than those specified in the Offering Member Notice, but only to the extent that such Transfer occurs within sixty (60) days following the expiration of the ROFR Rightholder Option Period (which period may be extended for a reasonable time not to exceed ninety (90) days to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain required approvals or consents from any Governmental Authority). Any Offered Units not Transferred within such 90-day period will be subject to the provisions of this Section 10.03 upon subsequent Transfer.

**(c) Distribution of Proceeds.**  The Liquidator shall liquidate the assets of the Company and Distribute the proceeds of such liquidation in the following order of priority, unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of Applicable Law:

**(c) Good Faith Reliance.**  A Covered Person shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Company and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements (including financial statements and information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value or amount of the assets, liabilities, Net Income or Net Losses of the Company or any facts pertinent to the existence and amount of assets from which Distributions might properly be paid) of the following Persons or groups: (i) another Manager; (ii) one or more Officers or employees of the Company; (iii) any attorney, independent accountant, appraiser or other expert or professional employed or engaged by or on behalf of the Company; or (iv) any other Person selected in good faith by or on behalf of the Company, in each case as to matters that such relying Person reasonably believes to be within such other Person&#39;s professional or expert competence. The preceding sentence shall in no way limit any Person&#39;s right to rely on information to the extent provided in § 18-406 of the California Act.

**Section 14.02 Liabilities and Duties of Covered Persons.**

**(a) Limitation of Liability.**  This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary duty on any Covered Person. Furthermore, each of the Members and the Company hereby waives any and all fiduciary duties that, absent such waiver, may be implied by Applicable Law, and in doing so, acknowledges and agrees that the duties and obligation of each Covered Person to each other and to the Company are only as expressly set forth in this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of a Covered Person otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Members to replace such other duties and liabilities of such Covered Person.

**(b) Duties.**  Whenever in this Agreement a Covered Person is permitted or required to make a decision (including a decision that is in such Covered Person&#39;s &quot;discretion&quot; or under a grant of similar authority or latitude), the Covered Person shall be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as such Covered Person desires, including its own interests, and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the Company or any other Person. Whenever in this Agreement a Covered Person is permitted or required to make a decision in such Covered Person&#39;s &quot;good faith,&quot; the Covered Person shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by this Agreement or any other Applicable Law.

**Section 14.03 Indemnification.**

**(a) Indemnification.**  To the fullest extent permitted by the California Act, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, substituted or replaced (but, in the case of any such amendment, substitution or replacement only to the extent that such amendment, substitution or replacement permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than the California Act permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment, substitution or replacement), the Company shall indemnify, hold harmless, defend, pay and reimburse any Covered Person against any and all losses, claims, damages, judgments, fines or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending against such losses, claims, damages, judgments, fines or liabilities, and any amounts expended in settlement of any claims (collectively, &quot; **Losses**&quot;) to which such Covered Person may become subject by reason of:

**(i)** Any act or omission or alleged act or omission performed or omitted to be performed on behalf of the Company, any Member or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the foregoing in connection with the business of the Company; or

**(ii)** The fact that such Covered Person is or was acting in connection with the business of the Company as a partner, member, stockholder, controlling Affiliate, manager, director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, any Member, or any of their respective controlling Affiliates, or that such Covered Person is or was serving at the request of the Company as a partner, member, manager, director, officer, employee or agent of any Person including the Company or any Company Subsidiary;

_provided_, that (x) such Covered Person acted in good faith and in a manner believed by such Covered Person to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, and (y) such Covered Person&#39;s conduct did not constitute fraud or willful misconduct, in either case as determined by a final, nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. In connection with the foregoing, the termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Covered Person did not act in good faith or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such Covered Person&#39;s conduct was unlawful, or that the Covered Person&#39;s conduct constituted fraud or willful misconduct.

**(b) Reimbursement.** The Company shall promptly reimburse (and/or advance to the extent reasonably required) each Covered Person for reasonable legal or other expenses (as incurred) of such Covered Person in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any claim, lawsuit or other proceeding relating to any Losses for which such Covered Person may be indemnified pursuant to this **Section 14.03** ; **provided** , that if it is finally judicially determined that such Covered Person is not entitled to the indemnification provided by this **Section 14.03** , then such Covered Person shall promptly reimburse the Company for any reimbursed or advanced expenses.

**(c) Entitlement to Indemnity.** The indemnification provided by this **Section 14.03** shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to indemnification to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any agreement or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 14.03 shall continue to afford protection to each Covered Person regardless of whether such Covered Person remains in the position or capacity pursuant to which such Covered Person became entitled to indemnification under this **Section 14.03** and shall inure to the benefit of the executors, administrators, legatees and distributees of such Covered Person.

**(d) Insurance.** To the extent available on commercially reasonable terms, the Company may purchase, at its expense, insurance to cover Losses covered by the foregoing indemnification provisions and to otherwise cover Losses for any breach or alleged breach by any Covered Person of such Covered Person&#39;s duties in such amount and with such deductibles as the Board may determine; _provided_, that the failure to obtain such insurance shall not affect the right to indemnification of any Covered Person under the indemnification provisions contained herein, including the right to be reimbursed or advanced expenses or otherwise indemnified for Losses hereunder. If any Covered Person recovers any amounts in respect of any Losses from any insurance coverage, then such Covered Person shall, to the extent that such recovery is duplicative, reimburse the Company for any amounts previously paid to such Covered Person by the Company in respect of such Losses.

**(e) Funding of Indemnification Obligation.** Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any indemnity by the Company relating to the matters covered in this **Section 14.03** shall be provided out of and to the extent of Company assets only, and no Member (unless such Member otherwise agrees in writing) shall have personal liability on account thereof or shall be required to make additional Capital Contributions to help satisfy such indemnity by the Company.

**(f) Savings Clause.** If this **Section 14.03** or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Company shall nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each Covered Person pursuant to this **Section 14.03** to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this **Section 14.03** that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.

**(g) Amendment.** The provisions of this **Section 14.03** shall be a contract between the Company, on the one hand, and each Covered Person who served in such capacity at any time while this **Section 14.03** is in effect, on the other hand, pursuant to which the Company and each such Covered Person intend to be legally bound. No amendment, modification or repeal of this **Section 14.03** that adversely affects the rights of a Covered Person to indemnification for Losses incurred or relating to a state of facts existing prior to such amendment, modification or repeal shall apply in such a way as to eliminate or reduce such Covered Person&#39;s entitlement to indemnification for such Losses without the Covered Person&#39;s prior written consent.

**Section 15.14 Equitable Remedies.**

Each party hereto acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach by such party of any of its obligations under this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm to the other parties, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by such party of any such obligations, each of the other parties hereto shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be available to them in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond).

In addition, any Units (including Stake Units) to be converted into or redeemed or exchanged for shares of the IPO Entity shall receive shares with substantially equivalent economic, governance, priority and other rights and privileges as in effect immediately prior to such transaction (disregarding the tax treatment of such transaction).
