In July 2016, we at NOBL adopted a new operating agreement to distribute greater control and equity to all of our workers.

This document took us months and thousands of dollars to generate. So naturally, we decided to give it away. If you care about distributing authority and equity to your employees, please take it, improve it, and share it with others.
